# PersonSegmentation

Let's formulate our task: we want to distinguish person on photo from other objects on background. In other words we are solving semantic segmentation problem. In this repo we introduce a short research on this problem, achieved 0.95 dice metrics.

- Ready-to-use solution is represented in Solution.ipynb. Dir /weights contains bests weights for model
- example.html consists of several photo examples of this model usage. It uses /html directory
- /exps contains several notebooks with motivation of solutions and ideas.
- /utils contains pipeline for Solution.ipynb and dataset
